## PyCity Schools Analysis

Due to interference related to formatting issues of the narrative as presented at the top of the PyCitySchools_starter file, the visual presentation of this PyCity Schools Analysis is poor.  As such, it is presented here.

The School District is comprised of 39,170 students attending 15 schools of which 8 are charter schools and 7 are district schools.  Math and reading scores for each of the students were provided and analyzed.  Overall, more students passed reading than math.  When considered together, approximately 65% of the total number of students received passing scores for both math and reading (at least 70%); in other words, an approximate 35% fail to pass both math and reading.

The analysis indicates that all of the 8 charter schools outperformed the 7 district schools.  The outperformance can be described as vast, for the average overall passing scores for charter schools and district schools are 90.43% and 53.67%, respectively.  In fact, the lowest performing charter school (Holden High School) had an overall passing score for both math and reading of 89.23%, whereas students in the highest performing district school (Bailey High School) had an overall passing score for both math and reading of 54.64%.   Similarly, individual average math and reading scores reflect the same outperformance by charter schools over district schools.  There is unanimity among charter and district schools that more students outperformed in reading than math.

An analysis of math and reading scores by grade indicates more consistency without significant deviation.  Among the 9th through 12th graders, inclusive, the minimum and maximum math scores were 75.91% and 85.00%, respectively.  With respect to reading scores, the minimum and maximum reading scores were 81.26% and 84.59%, respectively.  From these scores, these is less variation with reading scores than math scores.

An analysis of spending per student indicates that 4 schools had spent less than $585 per student, and each was a charter school.  Similarly, 3 schools had spent more than $645 per student, and each was a district school.

An analysis of average scores per school spending indicates a clear inverse proportional relationship between the two.  The overall average passing rate of 90.37% was enjoyed by those schools spending less than $585 per student, a rate of 81.41% for schools spending $585-$630 per student, a rate of 62.86% for schools spending $630-$645, and 53.53% for schools spending more than $645 per student.   

Given these metrics, it may be concluded that (1) charter schools outperform district schools when measured by math scores, reading scores, and a combined math and reading scores, and (2) the amount of spending per student does not reflect a better result in better math, reading, and a combined math and reading scores. 

It should be noted that the preceding conclusions are based on a very minimal amount of metrics.  The ability to attend charter schools could be determined as a function of a family’s ability to pay tuition.  Measurements inclusive of a family’s income level for each student as well as the addresses and zip codes of the student’s home could indicate neighborhoods that could be characterized as low-, middle-, a high-income neighborhoods which could indicate an ability to pay tuition.
